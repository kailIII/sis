 * Hard coded values (typically identifiers).

 * {@section When to use}
 * Those constants should be used mostly for names, aliases or identifiers. They should generally
 * not be used for abbreviations for instance, even if the abbreviation result in the same string.
 *
 * Those constants do not need to be used systematically in tests neither, especially when the test
 * builds its tested object itself.
